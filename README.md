# TMD3719 Arduino Library
I need this, so you can have it too!


## Missing Features
There are a number of features I haven't implemented, but that shouldn't be too difficult to add. That includes the GPIO, interrupts, the FIFO buffer and VSYNC features primarily, although Flicker might also be incomplete. Pull requests welcomed!

Here's the datasheet if you want to add anything - [TMD3719](https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/588/TMD3719_DS000748_2_00-1903311.pdf)
